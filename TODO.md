INSIDE ROOMS
- How do I invite people to an existing room?

CHOREO

CHOOSE A SONG FUNCTIONALITY
- choose a song page should have a player and have a "USE THIS SONG" button
- room settings does not have player or ff
- When I create a new room and choose "listen to a song," and I click on a genre...
    is it possible to make it apparent that I have selected something?
    As of now, it doesn't get highlighted or anything so it feels like nothing happened.
    Maybe there could be a button that says "done" or "save room" instead of just "back" ?



- Also, how would you like to highlight the wesleyan channel that i created?

- debug on android
